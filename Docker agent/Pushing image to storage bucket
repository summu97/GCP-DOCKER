docker tag <image_id> gcr.io/<project_id>/<image_name>:<tag>
docker push gcr.io/<project_id>/<image_name>:<tag>
gcloud auth configure-docker
docker push gcr.io/<project_id>/<image_name>:<tag>
 

Save the Docker image as a tarball:
docker save -o image.tar <image_name>:<tag>

Upload the tarball to GCS:
gsutil cp image.tar gs://your_bucket/path/image.tar

Keep in mind that this approach uploads the Docker image as a tarball, which means it won't be directly usable as a Docker image until it's loaded back into Docker. To load the image back into Docker from the tarball, you can use the docker load command:
docker load -i image.tar
